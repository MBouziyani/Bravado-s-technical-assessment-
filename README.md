# 🚗 Car Market API

## 📌 Overview
This is a **Car Market API** that provides a personalized selection of cars for users based on their preferences. It supports filtering by **brand, price range, and recommendations from an external AI service**. The API is optimized for performance and scalability.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
This project contains **two versions**:
- **`backend_test_assignment-master (basic-implementation)`** – The first version with a simple implementation.
- **`backend_test_assignment-master (final-version)`** – The final optimized version using a service object for better maintainability.
- **`Car Market API.postman_collection.json`** – Postman collection to test the API.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **User Preferences** – Users can specify preferred car brands and price range.  
✅ **Filtering** – Supports filtering by **brand** and **price range**.  
✅ **AI Recommendations** – Integrates an external recommendation system.  
✅ **Efficient Sorting & Pagination** – Ensures **fast performance** on large datasets.  
✅ **Test Coverage** – Fully tested with **RSpec**.  

---

## 🏗 Database Models
The following **models** are used in this project:

| Model                 | Attributes                                  | Description |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Brand`              | `name`                                      | Car brand (e.g., Toyota, BMW). |
| `Car`                | `model`, `brand_id`, `price`                | Cars available for sale. |
| `User`               | `email`, `preferred_price_range`            | Users looking for cars. |
| `UserPreferredBrand` | `user_id`, `brand_id`                      | Links a user to their preferred brands. |

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mbouziyani/Bravado-s-technical-assessment.git
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```sh
bundle install
```

### 3️⃣ Set up the database
```sh
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

### 4️⃣ Start the server
```sh
rails server
```
The API will be available at:  
**`http://localhost:3000/api/v1/cars`**  

---

## 📌 API Endpoints

### 🔍 **1. Get filtered cars**
**Endpoint:**  
```sh
GET /api/v1/cars
```
**Request Parameters:**
```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "query": "Toyota",
  "price_min": 20000,
  "price_max": 50000,
  "page": 1
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 179,
    "brand": {
      "id": 39,
      "name": "Volkswagen"
    },
    "model": "Derby",
    "price": 37230,
    "rank_score": 0.945,
    "label": "perfect_match"
  }
]
```

**Sorting Rules:**
- **Perfect Match** – Cars that match both the preferred brand and price range.
- **Good Match** – Cars that match only the preferred brand.
- **Other Cars** – Cars that don’t match user preferences.
- **Rank Score (DESC)** – Recommended cars appear first.
- **Price (ASC)** – Cheapest cars appear first.

---

## 🛠 Performance Optimizations
### ✅ **Using SQL Joins for Fast Filtering**
Instead of **separate queries**, we use efficient **ActiveRecord queries** to fetch only the required cars.

### ✅ **Efficient Pagination**
Instead of paginating **after sorting**, we **fetch only what’s needed** with `.page.per`.

### ✅ **Caching External API Data**
AI recommendations are cached for **24 hours** to avoid frequent slow API calls.

---

## 🎯 Design Patterns Used
### 🏗 **Service Object Pattern**
We refactored the filtering logic into a **separate service (`CarFinderService`)**.  
This improves **code maintainability** and makes the controller cleaner.

#### **`app/services/car_finder_service.rb`**
```ruby
class CarFinderService
  def initialize(user, params)
    @user = user
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    cars = filter_cars(Car.includes(:brand))
    cars = cars.page(@params[:page] || 1).per(20)

    recommended_cars = fetch_recommendations
    apply_labels_and_sort(cars, recommended_cars)
  end

  private

  def filter_cars(cars)
    cars = cars.where(price: @params[:price_min]..@params[:price_max]) if @params[:price_min].present? && @params[:price_max].present?
    cars = cars.joins(:brand).where("brands.name ILIKE ?", "%#{@params[:query]}%") if @params[:query].present?
    cars
  end
end
```

## 🔬 Running Tests
```sh
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec
```
✔ **100% Test Coverage** with **RSpec**!  

---

## 📝 Testing with Postman
A **Postman collection** is provided to **quickly test the API**.  
📂 **Location:** `postman/Car Market API.postman_collection.json`  

### **Steps to use it:**
1. Open **Postman**.
2. Click **Import** → **Select the JSON file**.
3. Set the base URL: `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Run the test requests!

---

## 📦 Deployment Notes
- The app **automatically handles large datasets**.
- Caching is **enabled** to prevent unnecessary API calls.
- The **database should be indexed** for better query performance.

---
